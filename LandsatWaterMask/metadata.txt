changelog=1.4.2 Added a clean “guided” dialog with live progress/log popup (run in foreground or background). Added Advanced PIXEL water code overrides for Landsat 4/5/7 vs 8/9. Lowered minimum QGIS requirement to 3.30.0. Refactored processing so classification GeoTIFFs are grouped by unique acquisition date and merged across all Path/Row groups on a matching extent. Added two methods of vector smoothing. Optimized for QT5 LTR.
